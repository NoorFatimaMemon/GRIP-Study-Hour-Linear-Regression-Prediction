# GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction

This repository focuses on utilizing linear regression techniques to predict percentage scores based on study hours. It provides comprehensive resources for data analysis, model training, and predictive analysis.

This is a sample code written by me for training the "StudyHours Scores Dataset", taken from "http://bit.ly/w-data". The implementation takes place within the Google Colab environment.

Currently, the code does:

Generate a summary of the training data, which can be found in GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction/out/data_summary.jpg, and an overview in the Google Colab GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction/out/study_hours_vs_percentage.jpg.

The data is trained on the linear Regression model, and the regression line plotting is shown in the GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction/out/study_hours_vs_percentage_with_regression_line.jpg.

The comparison of the data results can be seen under: GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction/out/Comparison_Actual_vs_Predicted_data.jpg.

The evaluation of the model can be seen under: GRIP-Study-Hour-Linear-Regression-Prediction/out/performance_metrics.jpg.
